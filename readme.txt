Project Title: GIKI ONLINE FOOD CORNER

--This project is web based application. Its main objective is to login into the user and get registered in the online food restaurants'
data. This will take the user to the menu page and then selection of menu and so on and so forth. About page serves its purpose on providing details of the project and why we choose this project.

--This project is device independent but for the time being it functions on local server for hosting our website, for a specific device in which xamp is installed (usually used for creating a local host, and the data is saved in mysql connecting it with php language.) which serves as providing a basis for making the project run.

--Our database resides in xamp local host server and the connection is done through php. so for the sake of letting the project work xamp must be installed first and a local host settings should be done as guided.

--Git link for our project is as under:
